## Blackjack Game ♥️ ♠️ ♦️ ♣️ 

# Description
I started to learn JavaScript on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/home) and this is the 2nd part of the course. It's very simple: you start the game by clicking a button and draw a new card by clicking the other one. You've got Black Jack if the sum of the cards is 21. If it's lower than that you can draw another card. If the sum is bigger than 21 you're out of the game!
